# Philosophy: Freedom from Fixed Stacks

Active development can be **dynamic and unpredictable**. PRStack embraces the chaos of real development. Instead of forcing you to pre-plan your branching strategy, it dynamically discovers your current stack by tracing from wherever you are back to the trunk. As a developer you are free to implement your own workflow, make branches however fits your needs. Later PRStack adapts to whatever shape your development tree has taken and helps you manage the PRs, making stack management feel effortless rather than burdensome.

## Alternative Tools

There are other PR stacking tools like [Git Machete](https://github.com/VirtusLab/git-machete) and [Graphite](https://graphite.dev/). These have their own strengths.

Graphite offers an amazing CLI and UI for viewing PR stacks and doing code reviews. It does require you to manually specify the stack each time, which makes it harder to react to structural changes or implement some more [advanced workflows](/docs/workflows/megamerge-workflow). It's also paid (with free tier), closed source and requires permissions to access your repository.

Git Machete is a strong tool, and while it does offer a way to discover stacks from the Git log, this command needs to be ran explicitely meaning the stack model can get outdated. Running commands can feel a bit clunky and it's not trivial to view, create and merge PRs using it.

You are responsible for managing your own Git log. If you are using git you can still use Graphite or Machete along with PRStack. [Jujutsu](https://github.com/martinvonz/jj) automatically rebases when altering the history so, when using Jujutsu, there is less need for these tools.

## How It Works

PrStack embraces a **branch-anywhere** philosophy:

1. **Work naturally**: Create branches wherever you need them in your development tree
2. **Dynamic discovery**: Run `prstack sync` from any branch to automatically discover the stack from your current position to trunk
3. **Adaptive management**: Switch to any other branch and run sync again - PrStack adapts to the new context
4. **Automatic PR creation**: Missing PRs are identified and can be created with a single prompt

## VCS Agnostic Design

PrStack is implemented in a way to work with any Version Control System. Currently it supports these VCSs:

- **[Jujutsu](https://github.com/martinvonz/jj)**: First-class support for the branchless VCS
- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)**: Traditional Git workflow support (coming soon)

More can be added in the future by implementing the [VCS protocol](https://github.com/yannvanhalewyn/prstack/blob/main/src/prstack/vcs.clj#L18)
Since [Jujutsu](https://github.com/martinvonz/jj) is branchless by design, PrStack continues this philosophy by constantly adapting to the current shape of your development tree, rather than forcing you into rigid branch structures.
