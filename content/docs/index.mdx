# PrStack

A VCS-agnostic CLI and TUI app for effortless PR stack management that embraces the chaos of day-to-day development.

## CLI + TUI: Your Choice

PrStack offers two ways to work:
- **TUI App**: Run `prstack` for an interactive terminal interface to detect, navigate, and manage your stacks with visual diffs, PR creation, merging, and more
- **CLI Commands**: Use individual commands like `prstack sync` for quick, scriptable operations in your existing workflow

## Why PrStack?

Traditional PR stack tools require upfront planning and adherence to predefined structures. PrStack recognizes that development is organic - you branch where needed, pivot when requirements change, and explore multiple approaches simultaneously. Making PRs is an afterthought, and `prstack` comes in at the right time to help you manage them when the time comes.

By dynamically discovering your stack based on your current context, PrStack eliminates the friction of stack management while maintaining the benefits of organized, reviewable changes.

## Quick Example

```bash
# Branch off main for feature A
jj new -m "Feature A"
jj bookmark create feature-a

# Branch off feature-a for feature B
jj new -m "Feature B"
jj bookmark create feature-b

# From feature-b: sync discovers feature-b → feature-a → main
prstack sync
```
