## Usage

```bash
prstack list [options]
```

## Options

### `--include-prs`

```bash
prstack list --include-prs
```

## How It Works

The `list` command:

1. Traces from your current branch back to the trunk
2. Spec
2. Displays each branch in the stack
3. Optionally fetches and displays PR information for each branch

## When to Use

- Quickly see your current stack structure
- Verify which branches are in your stack
- Check PR status for branches in your stack
- Get PR URLs for sharing or reference
