# Command: `list`

Lists the current PR stack from your position to trunk.

## Usage

```bash
prstack list [options]
```

## Options

<TypeTable
  type={{
    "--include-prs": {
      description: "The VCS backend to use. Currently supported: `:jujutsu` and `:git`",
      type: ":jujutsu or :git",
      default: ":jujutsu",
    },
    "--all": {
      description: "A set of branches to ignore. Supports '*' wildcards.",
      type: "set<string>",
    },
    ":feature-base-branches": {
      description: "A set of branches that are feature bases. When PrStack discovers your stack, any branches in this set will be treated as a trunk for other stacks. This is also managed via the prstack feature-base command. Supports '*' wildcards",
      type: "set<string>",
    },
  }}
/>

## Options

### `--include-prs`

Include associated PR URLs in the output.

```bash
prstack list --include-prs
```

## How It Works

The `list` command:

1. Traces from your current branch back to the trunk
2. Spec
2. Displays each branch in the stack
3. Optionally fetches and displays PR information for each branch

## When to Use

Use `prstack list` when you want to:

- Quickly see your current stack structure
- Verify which branches are in your stack
- Check PR status for branches in your stack
- Get PR URLs for sharing or reference
