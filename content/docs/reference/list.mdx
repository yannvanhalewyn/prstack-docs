# prstack list

Lists the current PR stack from your position to trunk.

## Usage

```bash
prstack list [options]
```

## Options

### `--include-prs`

Include associated PR URLs in the output.

```bash
prstack list --include-prs
```

## Examples

### Basic List

```bash
prstack list

# Output:
# feature-c
# feature-a
# main
```

### With PR URLs

```bash
prstack list --include-prs

# Output:
# feature-c (https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123)
# feature-a (https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/122)
# main
```

## How It Works

The `list` command:

1. Traces from your current branch back to the trunk
2. Displays each branch in the stack
3. Optionally fetches and displays PR information for each branch

## When to Use

Use `prstack list` when you want to:

- Quickly see your current stack structure
- Verify which branches are in your stack
- Check PR status for branches in your stack
- Get PR URLs for sharing or reference
