# prstack create-prs

Creates missing pull requests for the current stack.

## Usage

```bash
prstack create-prs
```

## What It Does

The `create` command:

1. **Discovers your stack** from the current position to trunk
2. **Identifies missing PRs** between adjacent branches in the stack
3. **Prompts to create each missing PR** with appropriate base branches

## Example

```bash
prstack create-prs

# Output:
# Discovered stack: feature-c → feature-a → main
# Missing PRs:
#   - feature-a → main
#   - feature-c → feature-a
#
# Create PR for feature-a → main? (y/n) y
# Creating PR...
# Created: https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/122
#
# Create PR for feature-c → feature-a? (y/n) y
# Creating PR...
# Created: https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
```

## PR Base Branches

PrStack automatically sets the correct base branch for each PR:

- For a stack `feature-c → feature-a → main`:
  - `feature-a` PR targets `main`
  - `feature-c` PR targets `feature-a`

This ensures that PRs in your stack are properly chained.

## When to Use

Use `prstack create-prs` when you want to:

- Create PRs for a new stack of branches
- Fill in missing PRs after branching off existing work
- Ensure all branches in your stack have associated PRs
