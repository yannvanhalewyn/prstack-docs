# TUI App

Run `prstack` without arguments to launch the interactive TUI (Terminal User Interface).

## Usage

```bash
prstack
```

## Features

The TUI provides a full-featured interface for managing your PR stacks:

- **Stack Detection**: Automatically detect and visualize your current PR stack
- **Visual representation**: Visually see
- **Navigation**: Browse through your stack with keyboard shortcuts
- **Visual Diffs**: View diffs between branches using your favorite diffing tool
- **PR Management**: Create, refresh, and merge PRs interactively

## Interface

The TUI interface provides:

- A tree view of your current stack
- Branch relationships and PR status
- Interactive commands for stack operations
- Visual feedback for all actions

## When to Use the TUI

The TUI is ideal when you want:

- A visual overview of your entire stack
- To perform multiple operations in sequence
- Interactive exploration of your branch structure
- Real-time feedback during stack management

For quick, scriptable operations, use the [CLI commands](/docs/commands/sync) instead.
