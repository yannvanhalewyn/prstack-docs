# Configuration

PrStack can be configured using a `.prstack/config.edn` file in your repository root.

## Configuration File

Create a `.prstack/config.edn` file in your repository:

<TypeTable
  type={{
    ":vcs": {
      description: "The VCS backend to use. Currently supported: `:jujutsu` and `:git`",
      type: ":jujutsu or :git",
      default: ":jujutsu",
    },
    ":ignored-branches": {
      description: "A set of branches to ignore. Supports '*' wildcards.",
      type: "set<string>",
    },
    ":feature-base-branches": {
      description: "A set of branches that are feature bases. When PrStack discovers your stack, any branches in this set will be treated as a trunk for other stacks. This is also managed via the prstack feature-base command. Supports '*' wildcards",
      type: "set<string>",
    },
  }}
/>

See the [feature base command](/docs/reference/feature-base) for more information about `:feature-base-branches`.

*Example Configuration:*

Here's a complete example configuration file:

```clojure
{:vcs :jujutsu ;; default
 :ignored-branches #{"deploy" "experimental" "temp-*" "wip-*"}
 :feature-base-branches #{"feature-redesign" "experimental-api" "feature-base-*}}
```
