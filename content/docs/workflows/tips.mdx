# Tips for better workflows

Below are some tips and tricks for PR stacking workflows.

## 1. Name Branches Descriptively

```bash
# Good: Shows owner for collaboration and hierarchy in naming
tom/feature-base-auth
tom/feature-auth-backend
tom/feature-auth-frontend
tom/feature-auth-docs

# Bad: Hard to understand relationships
auth-base
auth
backend
frontend
```

Clear branch names help you and your team understand the stack structure at a glance.

## 2. Use Feature Bases for Big Features

If you find yourself with more than a couple of branches in a stack, consider using a feature base to organize the work.

Feature bases help you:
- Group related work streams
- Manage parallel development
- Create logical merge points

See the [feature-base command](/docs/reference/feature-base) for more details.

## 3. Keep PR Sizes Reasonable

Even in deep stacks, keep individual PRs small:
- Aim for < 500 lines changed per PR
- One logical change per PR
- Stack depth is fine; PR size should be small

Benefits:
- Faster reviews
- Easier to understand changes
- Simpler to fix issues
- Lower risk of conflicts

## 4. Use Draft PRs for WIP

Create PRs as drafts as soon as some work has been done. Convert to ready when the entire stack is complete.

This does the following:

- The work is still in progress
- Others can see your progress and code changes
- Signals they don't need to spend time on detailed review yet
- Ensures work is always backed up as soon as you start

## 5. Sync Frequently

Run `prstack sync` often:
- Before starting new work
- After making commits
- After merging PRs

Frequent syncing:
- Keeps your PRs up to date
- Ensures remote is up to date
- Reduces merge conflicts when collaborating

## 6. Communicate with Your Team

When working with stacked PRs, it's good to keep a good naming convention in PR names. Something like `dashboard-featurs: api-layer 1 - add basic api layer`

*note*: having PRStack also maintain comments about the stack with links to other PR is something I'm considering. Submit a feature request issue if you'd like to see this.

## 7. Use the TUI for Exploration

The Terminal UI is great for:
- Understanding stack structure and exploring PR structure
- Viewing diffs between branches
- Creating and merging PRs
