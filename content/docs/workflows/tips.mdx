# Tips for Advanced Workflows

## 1. Name Branches Descriptively

```bash
# Good: Shows hierarchy
tom/feature-base-auth
tom/feature-auth-backend
tom/feature-auth-frontend
tom/feature-auth-docs

# Bad: Hard to understand relationships
auth-base
auth
backend
frontend
```

Clear branch names help you and your team understand the stack structure at a glance.

## 2. Use Feature Bases for Big Features

If you find yourself with more than a couple of branches in a stack, consider using a feature base to organize the work.

Feature bases help you:
- Group related work streams
- Manage parallel development
- Create logical merge points

See the [feature-base command](/docs/reference/feature-base) for more details.

## 3. Document Stack Structure

Add comments to your PRs explaining the stack:

```markdown
# Stack Position

This PR is part of the user authentication stack:
- #123 feature-auth → main (foundation)
- #124 feature-auth-backend → feature-auth (this PR)
- #125 feature-auth-frontend → feature-auth (parallel)
```

This helps reviewers understand:
- Where this PR fits in the larger feature
- What other PRs to review
- The order of merging

## 4. Keep PR Sizes Reasonable

Even in deep stacks, keep individual PRs small:
- Aim for < 500 lines changed per PR
- One logical change per PR
- Stack depth is fine; PR size should be small

Benefits:
- Faster reviews
- Easier to understand changes
- Simpler to fix issues
- Lower risk of conflicts

## 5. Use Draft PRs for WIP

Mark PRs as draft while the stack is still being developed:

```bash
gh pr create --draft --base feature-auth --title "WIP: Auth backend"
```

Convert to ready when the entire stack is complete.

This signals to reviewers:
- The work is still in progress
- Don't spend time on detailed review yet
- The stack structure may still change

## 6. Sync Frequently

Run `prstack sync` often:
- Before starting new work
- After making commits
- Before requesting reviews
- After pulling updates

Frequent syncing:
- Keeps your PRs up to date
- Ensures remote is up to date
- Reduces merge conflicts when collaborating

## 7. Communicate with Your Team

When working with stacked PRs, it's good to keep a good naming convention in PR names. Something like `dashboard-featurs: api-layer 1 - add basic api layer`

*note*: having PRStack also maintain comments about the stack with links to other PR is something I'm considering. Submit a feature request issue if you'd like to see this.

## 8. Use the TUI for Exploration

The Terminal UI is great for:
- Understanding stack structure and exploring PR structure
- Viewing diffs between branches
- Creating and merging PRs
