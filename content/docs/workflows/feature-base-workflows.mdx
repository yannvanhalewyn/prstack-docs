# Parallel Development Workflows

## Working on Multiple Independent Stacks

You can have multiple independent stacks in your repository simultaneously:

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme':'base', 'themeVariables': {'git0':'#6366f1','git1':'#f59e0b','git2':'#8b5cf6','git3':'#8b5cf6','git4':'#f59e0b','git5':'#10b981','git6':'#10b981'}}}%%
gitGraph
  commit id: "main"
  branch feature-auth
  commit id: "Auth: Setup"
  branch feature-auth-ui
  commit id: "Login page"
  branch feature-auth-api
  commit id: "Auth endpoints"
  checkout main
  branch feature-payments
  commit id: "Payment: Setup"
  branch feature-payments-ui
  commit id: "Checkout page"
  branch feature-payments-api
  commit id: "Payment endpoints"
```

PrStack discovers whichever stack you're currently working on:

```bash
# Work on auth stack
git checkout feature-auth-ui
prstack list
# Output:
# feature-auth-ui
# feature-auth
# main

# Switch to payments stack
git checkout feature-payments-api
prstack list
# Output:
# feature-payments-api
# feature-payments
# main
```

## Cross-Stack Dependencies

If stacks need to depend on each other, branch from the dependency:

```bash
# Payments depends on auth
git checkout feature-auth
git checkout -b feature-payments

# Now payments stack builds on auth
git checkout feature-payments-api
prstack list
# Output:
# feature-payments-api
# feature-payments
# feature-auth  ← dependency
# main
```

## Benefits of Parallel Stacks

1. **Context switching**: Work on different features without interference
2. **Independent progress**: Features can move forward at their own pace
3. **Team coordination**: Multiple team members can work on separate stacks
4. **Reduced conflicts**: Independent stacks minimize merge conflicts

## Managing Multiple Stacks

### Keeping Track

Use descriptive branch names to identify which stack each branch belongs to:

```bash
# Auth stack
feature-auth
feature-auth-backend
feature-auth-frontend

# Payments stack
feature-payments
feature-payments-backend
feature-payments-frontend
```

### Switching Between Stacks

PrStack automatically detects your current context:

```bash
# Work on auth
git checkout feature-auth-backend
prstack sync  # Only syncs auth stack

# Switch to payments
git checkout feature-payments-frontend
prstack sync  # Only syncs payments stack
```

### Syncing All Stacks

To update all your stacks at once, you can script it:

```bash
# Sync multiple stacks
for branch in feature-auth feature-payments; do
  git checkout $branch
  prstack sync
done
```
