# PRStack

PRStack is a flexible tool that embraces the chaos of day to day development. It allows you to create any workflows your Version Control System (VCS) supports, and offers commands to manage Pull Requests (PR) based on the current state of the commit log.

It also supports a bunch of [workflows](/docs/workflows) that will make it a lot easier to make lots of small incremental Pull Requests. These workflows are also very suitable for modern parallelized AI powered development.

It's free and open source.

## CLI and TUI app

PrStack offers two ways to work:
- **TUI App**: Run `prstack` for an interactive terminal interface to detect, navigate, and manage your stacks with visual diffs, PR creation, merging, and more
- **CLI Commands**: Use individual commands like `prstack sync` for quick, scriptable operations in your existing workflow

## Benefits

Using PRStack reduces the overhead of creating and merging PRs to a mere afterthought. Wether you make a few PRs here and there, or are in active development creating dozens of PRs per week, PRStack provides all the regular actions at the press of a button.

## How it works

import { Step, Steps } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';

<Steps>
  <Step>
  Work on a feature. Make one or more branches, stacked, parallel or any mix
  </Step>
  <Step>
  At any moment, invoking `prstack` will read your commit history into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Using this DAG, PRStack can visualize and manage your PRs
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Reasoning

Traditional PR stacking tools require planning and adherence to predefined structures. PRStack recognizes that development is organic - you branch where needed, pivot when requirements change, and explore multiple approaches simultaneously. Making PRs is an afterthought. A good PR management tool comes in at the right time to help you manage them, when you are ready.

By dynamically discovering your stack based on your current context, PRStack eliminates the friction of imperative stack management.

## Quick Example

<Tabs items={['Jujutsu', 'Git']}>
  <Tab value="Jujutsu">

```bash
# Create feature-a branch
jj new -m "Feature A"
jj bookmark create feature-a
# Create feature-b branch
jj new -m "Feature B"
jj bookmark create feature-b
# From feature-b: sync discovers feature-b → feature-a → main
prstack sync
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Git">

```bash
# Create feature-a branch
git checkout -b feature-a
# Create feature-b branch
git checkout -b feature-b
prstack sync
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>
