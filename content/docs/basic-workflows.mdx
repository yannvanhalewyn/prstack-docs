# Basic Workflow

This guide walks you through a typical PrStack workflow.

## Creating a Stack

Start by creating branches naturally as you would normally:

```bash
# Branch off main for feature A
jj new -m "Feature A"
jj bookmark create feature-a

# Make some changes and commit
# ...

# Branch off feature-a for feature B
jj new -m "Feature B"
jj bookmark create feature-b

# Make some changes and commit
# ...
```

## Syncing Your Stack

When you're ready to create PRs, run sync:

```bash
prstack sync
```

This will:
1. Fetch latest changes from remote
2. Update your local trunk (main)
3. Discover your stack: `feature-b → feature-a → main`
4. Ask if you want to rebase on trunk (if trunk changed)
5. Push your branches
6. Offer to create missing PRs

## Creating PRs

When prompted to create PRs, PrStack will:

- Create a PR for `feature-a` targeting `main`
- Create a PR for `feature-b` targeting `feature-a`

This ensures your PRs are properly chained.

## Branching Off Mid-Stack

One of PrStack's strengths is adapting to changes:

```bash
# Switch back to feature-a
jj edit feature-a

# Create a new branch off feature-a
jj new -m "Feature C"
jj bookmark create feature-c

# Sync from this new context
prstack sync

# Discovers: feature-c → feature-a → main
# (feature-b is not in this stack)
```

## Listing Your Stack

At any time, check your current stack:

```bash
prstack list --include-prs
```

## Using the TUI

For a more interactive experience:

```bash
prstack
```

This launches the Terminal UI where you can:
- View your stack visually
- See diffs between branches
- Create, merge, and manage PRs interactively

## Tips

- **Run sync often**: It's safe to run `prstack sync` frequently
- **Branch anywhere**: Don't worry about planning your stack upfront
- **Let PrStack adapt**: Switch branches and run sync again - it will figure out your new context
- **Use the TUI for exploration**: When you want to understand your stack structure
- **Use CLI for speed**: When you know exactly what you want to do
