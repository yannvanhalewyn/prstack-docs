# prstack sync

Syncs your current stack with the remote repository.

## Usage

```bash
prstack sync
```

## What It Does

The `sync` command performs the following operations in order:

1. **Fetches latest changes** from the remote repository
2. **Updates local trunk** to match the remote trunk branch
3. **Discovers current stack** by tracing from your current position back to trunk
4. **Optionally rebases** the stack on the updated trunk (only if trunk changed)
5. **Pushes tracked branches** to the remote
6. **Offers to create missing PRs** for branches without pull requests

## Dynamic Stack Discovery

The key feature of `prstack sync` is its dynamic stack discovery. It doesn't require you to pre-define your stack structure. Instead, it automatically discovers your stack by tracing from wherever you are back to the trunk branch.

## Example

```bash
# You're on feature-b which is based on feature-a
# feature-a is based on main

prstack sync

# Output:
# Fetching from remote...
# Updating trunk (main)...
# Discovered stack: feature-b → feature-a → main
# Trunk has new commits, rebase? (y/n)
# Pushing branches...
# Missing PRs detected:
#   - feature-a → main
#   - feature-b → feature-a
# Create missing PRs? (y/n)
```

## When to Use

Use `prstack sync` when you want to:

- Update your stack with the latest changes from remote
- Ensure your stack is in sync before creating PRs
- Rebase your entire stack on the latest trunk
- Quickly identify and create missing PRs
