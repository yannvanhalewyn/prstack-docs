description: List the current PR stack

# Command: `list`

Lists the current PR stack from your position to trunk.

## Usage

```bash
prstack list [options]
```

## Options

### `--exclude-prs` (or `-E`)

Skip fetching PR information. By default, `prstack list` fetches and displays PR URLs for each branch in the stack. Use this flag to disable PR fetching for faster execution, which is useful in scripting scenarios where PR information isn't needed.

```bash
prstack list --exclude-prs
```

### `--all`

List all branches in the stack, not just from the current position to trunk.

```bash
prstack list --all
```

## How It Works

The `list` command:

1. Traces from your current branch back to the trunk
2. Displays each branch in the stack
3. Fetches and displays PR information for each branch (unless `--exclude-prs` is used)

## When to Use

Use `prstack list` when you want to:

- Quickly see your current stack structure
- Verify which branches are in your stack
- Check PR status for branches in your stack
- Get PR URLs for sharing or reference
